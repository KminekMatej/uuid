A very fast UUID and snowflake generator
========================================

After looking at other libraries, they seem very complex for the most common use case:
generating UUIDs. Now, UUIDs are quite complex in themselves, and it is easy to make mistakes
so that the UUID is not truly unique. That's why I feel the library should be as simple as
possible, so that it is easy to review.

Features:

 * UUID v4 using cryptographically strong randomness

 * UUID v1

 * COMB UUID v4 - All new UUIDs will be larger than the previous. The UUID is built from
   a 60 bit timestamp, a 14 bit sequence number and a 48 bit machine id. In this implementation
   the UUID will validate as a proper UUID v4, which means that any picky third party software
   which validates the UUID will treat the UUID as a compliant version 4 UUID.

 * Snowflake UID - 64 bit increasing ID suitable for database primary keys

 * Instaflake UID - a variation of the Snowflake UID

 * Sonyflake UID - another variation of Snowflake

This library provides two classes and has no dependencies and performs very well. The UUID v4
is cryptographic random (via `random_bytes()`), while UUID v1 tries to find the MAC address
or another unique machine ID. To reduce the risk of collisions, the process id is used to
to reduce the chance of a single machine generating two identical IDs.


Benchmarks
----------

### First UUID is generated almost as quickly as the native PECL extension

### Faster then the native PECL extension for many UUIDs.

### Summary

See the `BENCHMARKS.md` file for full details. The noteworthy details are:

1. Less then 1 ms to generate the first UUID, *10.5 milliseconds* faster than `ramsey/uuid` for UUID v1 and
   3.9 ms faster for UUID v4.
2. Overhead is related to loading of the source files.

Are these UUIDs truly unique?
-----------------------

### UUID(4)

The random UUID(4) generated by this library are industrial strength, directly using the entropy
from the operating system via the `random_bytes()` function.


### UUID(1)

The time and place based UUID(1) algorithm was implemented while taking into account bug reports
and experiences made in other libraries. Subtle issues that can arise is related to forking of
the process and The algorithm for building the bytes is an exact port
of the C code provided in [appendix A of the RFC 4122](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4122#appendix-A).

However, the `microtime(true)` function in PHP does not provide an accurate enough time resolution,



A lot of effort was put into 
defining the UUID standard, and a they are considered to be unique for all practical purposes.

UUID v4 is the simplest to use, but they require 16 bytes of storage each. They need no 
configuration, and they can be generated very quickly. If all companies in the world generate 
a total of 1 billion UIDs every second, the first collision is expected to happen after about 
85 years. After those 85 years, most of these UUIDs will have vanished anyway.

Snowflake ID are only 8 bytes (64 bits) and can safely be be used inside your own databases. 
They were invented by Twitter and is used to generate unique IDs for tweets, users, things, 
images and so on. To ensure uniqueness, you may configure a unique machineId, but the library
will automatically pick an available machine id from the operating system if you don't.

UUID v1 is a "coordinate" using the clock and a unique machine id derived from the mac address
or another unique 48 bit machine identifier. They are also automatically configured in this 
library.


Warning
-------

Please run some tests in your environment before using this library. Particularly, ensure
that the server has enough entropy available if you're using UUID version 4. Entropy is random
numbers generated from network noise and other sources.

UUIDs version 4 are considered production ready, but the other IDs need some more scrutiny
before we can declare them production ready. Please let me know if you spot any problems.


Quick Start
-----------

If you're not using a service container, the quickest way to begin is by using the function
`Charm\Id::make()`. The returned value will be a cryptographically random 128 bit value
in UUID v4 form (XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX).


### Installation

As with most PHP packages, install `composer` and run

```bash
# composer require charm/uuid
```

Alternatively you can of course clone the repository from https://github.com/charm-php/uuid
and include the `./autoload.php` file we've provided.


### UUID v4

This is the fastest and easiest to use, as it has no configuration options. The probability 
of a collission is microscopic. The number of different combinations is approximately 5,3169e+36. 

*If collisions happen, it is because of bugs in the generator. The ramsay
If you've heard that collisions happen, you can be quite certain that the collision happened
because of using an inferior random number generator.*

Quotes from around the web:

| If you generate 103 trillion UUID v4, the probability of a collision is about 1 in a billion.

| If you have a database of 1 petabyte of UUIDs, the probability of a single collision is
| one in 50 billion.

| If you generate 8 billion UUIDs per second, 


```php
<?php
echo Charm\Id::make();
// "47e3c427-3f82-4dc7-a6ca-c83561a9cdfb"
```` 

### UUID v1

This UUID is guaranteed to be unique, provided you have a unique machine ID - for example using
a MAC address.

```php
<?php
echo Charm\Id::v1();
// "c85fb57a-f391-11eb-bb00-0242ee781401"
```


```php
<?php
/**
 * UUID v4
 *
 * An ID that can be shared with others, and you should never see a collision.
 */
$uniqueId = Charm\Id::make();               // returns a 36 char string
// "47e3c427-3f82-4dc7-a6ca-c83561a9cdfb"

/**
 * Snowflake, by Twitter
 *
 * A 64 bit integer which can be considered unique within your organization, built from
 * a timestamp, a machine id and a sequence number.
 */
$snowflakeId = Charm\Id::snowflake(); // returns 64 bit int value
// 262805082062461697
```

Configuration is done via the `IdFactory` constructor, or the `Id::configure()` method.

Comparison:
-----------

* UUID v1 provides an 128 bit RFC4122 compliant UUID version 1 variant 1. It is designed to
  be globally unique for any datacenter and computer, always. It uses 48 bits to uniquely 
  identify the computer it runs on, and a 60 bit timestamp in 100 nanosecond increments 
  since 15th October 1582. The probability for a collision is extremely small.

* UUID v4 provides an 128 bit RFC4122 compliant UUID v4 variant 1 (also aka GUID). It is 
  built from a very large 122 bit random number. The generator uses a random_bytes() which
  consumes random numbers which are considered cryptographically secure.

* COMB UUID camouflages as a 128 bit RFC4122 compliant UUID v4, but it is built using the same
  principles as UUID v1: 60 bit timestamp, 14 bit sequence ID and 48 bit machine ID in a
  sorted order. 

* Snowflake is a 64 bit integer, which is suitable for storing in databases and is able to
  guarantee unique IDs across data centers and servers - provided that the machine ID is
  unique. 

* Instaflake and Sonyflake are variations of Snowflake, with different priorities with regard
  to timestamp resolution and number of machines.


Snowflake and variants are usually sufficient for any internal ID scheme up to Twitter or
Instagram scale. UUIDs are by many considered to be too large to be used extensively 
internally in a database - but are very useful to generate unique IDs for APIs or for allowing
external clients to generate IDs offline.
